## Firefox stuff

1. firefox sync account. (in the settings)
    This is to let you synchronize stuff.

2. Test pilot
    https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments
    Quite good stuff : 
        Min Vid is great
        Tab Center was amazing but it got retired (to fix bugs and stuff)
        other can be good / I don't really use it.
    
3. Other addons
    https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/eff-technologists/?src=api
    - HTTPS Everywhere
    - Privacy Badger
    
    https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/gorhill/?src=api
    - uBlock Origin

    https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/piro-piro_or/?src=api
    This guy is just freaking amazing. Instant fan 
    - Tree Style Tab
        F1 to toggle the tab. (Don't forget it's the same panel than bookmarks/history :d)
        You can switch to black in the addons setting. Frankly I would prefer it a little bit lighter.
    - Multiple Tab Handler
        Cause now you want to move your tabs in groups :3

4. userChrome.css
    - to put in ~/.mozilla/firefox/<randomstring>.default/chrome 
    chrome folder probably won't exist though.

5. userContent.css
    same as userChrome.css
    

I think I didn't forget anything? :/ Dunno really
Still a work in progress :)
